/*
   FIFO   first in first out
   if you add an item to the queue you will have to wait for all other items
   in the queue to be removed before your new item is in the front of teh queue

   Queues have their own way of doing things, A queue is an interface and not a class,
    is more like a template that we can apply to another class
   A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing
   Linear data structure

   add = enqueue, offer()
   remove = dequeue, poll()
